        <h3>Imran Baig, CPA</h3>
        <p>
          I began my career in the nonprofit world straight out of college,
          starting as a staff accountant while earning my Certified Professional
          Accountant (CPA) credential. I worked my way up to accounting manager,
          then financial analyst, and, finally, interim controller at Lutheran
          Social Services, where I spent 11 years. I enjoy the detail work of
          accounting along with the mentoring aspect. As a self-proclaimed
          numbers nerd, I found that I wanted to share my skills and expertise
          to support and guide others in their businesses.
